This assignment will not be graded and as such doesn’t require you to hand something in.

After the session, a example solution will be made available on Toledo.



The online variant of http://beta/fightcodegame.com/ requires an active GitHub account. In case the web site is down or you don't want to create an account, you are provided with a local down-sized copy of the web site. 

First, download the `fightcode.tar.gz` file from Toledo.

Next, open a terminal and run the following commands.   

Unpack the tarball in your home directory `/home/<studentnumber>`:      

tar zxf fightcode_offline.tar.gz 

Run the built-in Python web server to host the local copy of FightGameCode:      

cd /home/<studentnumber>/cpl-javascript/fightcode     

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 

Last, open a new browser window and go to http://localhost:8888. Be aware that your local version might slightly differ from the online version.
