Create a contract net protocol implementation for a pickup and delivery problem. For this exercise only the task allocation problem is relevant, e.g. what vehicle is delivering what package.

    use the PlaneRoadModel as road (as used in SimpleExample) so that vehicle routing becomes simple
    use the DefaultPDPModel for the pickup and delivery problem (as used in TaxiExample)
    use the CommModel for communication (as used in CommExample)
