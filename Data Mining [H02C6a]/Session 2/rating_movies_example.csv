1,1,,3,,,Letâ€™s predict rating for movie 6 by user C.,,
2,2,,3,,,,,
3,3,,3,,,Both A and B have rated this movie.,,
4,3,4,,,,,,
5,5,4,,,,1). Compute similarity between C and A,"w(A,C) = ((1-2.7)*(3-3.3) + (2-2.7)*(3-3.2) + (3-2.7)*(3-3.2))/(sqrt((1-2.7)^2+(2-2.7)^2+(3-2.7)^2)*sqrt((3-3.2)^2+(3-3.2)^2+(3-3.2)^2))",0.91
6,2,4,?,,,2). Compute similarity between C and B,"w(B,C) = ((4-3.7)*(2-3.3) + (4-3.7)*(5-3.3))/(sqrt((4-3.7)^2+(4-3.7)^2)*sqrt((2-3.3)^2+(5-3.3)^2))",0.13
7,,2,,,,3). Compute normalization constant,"alpha = |w(C,A)| + |w(C,B)|",1.04
