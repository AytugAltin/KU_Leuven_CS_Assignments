<bf> Abstract</bf>
<p>
The vision of the Semantic Web is exciting: intelligent clients will use the Web to do tasks for us. Yet in reality,
we have not seen too much of the Semantic Web. Why are developers not building apps with this vast source of
knowledge? In this lecture, I will explain why our current implementation of the Semantic Web is suffering from
scalability problems, which hinder widespread usage. As an alternative, I propose more lightweight interfaces that
better divide the load between clients and servers. The important lesson, however, is that no silver bullet exists:
each design choice we make comes with advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the
consequences of each option - especially if we want the Semantic Web to be truly decentralized. If we want to see truly
intelligent clients, instead of intelligent servers, we need to think in different ways.
