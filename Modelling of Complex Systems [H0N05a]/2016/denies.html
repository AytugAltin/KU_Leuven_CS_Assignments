<bf> Abstract</bf>
<p>
Provenance is defined by the W3C as "information about entities, activities,
and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used
to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness." In
other words, provenance can be seen as the "history" or "lineage" of a piece
of data or a thing. This "history" is particularly important when judging
the trust we place in that data or thing. For example, when buying a
painting, you want to know where it came from, who made it, who owned it in
the past, where it has been, etc.
</p><p>
While the importance of provenance has been known in many domains for a long
time now, until recently, most solutions to produce, maintain and consume it
were ad-hoc and/or domain-specific. However, since 2013 there is a standard
called W3C PROV, which makes it possible to assert and interchange
provenance in an interoperable way. This means that provenance produced by
one application can seamlessly be consumed an understood by another. In this
talk, I will introduce the key components necessary to create such
interoperable provenance. I will also provide a number of real-world
examples. and emerging applications involving provenance to illustrate its
importance.</p>
